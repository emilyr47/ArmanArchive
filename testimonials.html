                <p id="card-text">One of my favorite things about working closely with Bailey has been watching her step up and grow as a leader; she took on additional responsibilities throughout her tenure and readily shared her expertise with others. She served in her role as managing editor for Backpack (formerly CLAgency) for several semesters. In that time she shepherded 60+ features stories from first draft to publication, wrote or honed multiple social media posts for each of them, built and mailed numerous newsletters to wide alumni and donor audiences using Salesforce Marketing Cloud, trained and coached writers on best practices, advised leadership, provided support for a vast network of Drupal websites, and managed several technical writing projects. In editing content, I relied on her to catch anything that didn’t make sense and to identify opportunities for development, and then implement her solutions. Bailey is both highly detail-oriented and aware of how her work supports broader business goals. I enthusiastically recommend her!</p>

                    Backpack (previously CLAgency), I appreciated how she advocated for her writers and stepped up to
                    provide leadership and training for new people joining the team. She had great ideas for setting up
                    processes to make workflow run more smoothly. She brings intelligence and warmth to her work, and we
                    appreciated her taking on additional projects. She is a gem!</p>

                <p id="card-text">Aside from being Backpack’s resident copyediting powerhouse, Bailey was a true delight to work with.
                    From patiently helping learn various tasks, processes, and tools to explaining niche work details to
                    simply talking during agency meetings, Bailey made the transition into Backpack comfortable and
                    smooth. You can tell both talking to her directly and seeing her interact with others that she has a
                    genuine interest and investment in making people feel comfortable, welcome, and included in office
                    culture. Further, as an editor, Bailey gave feedback that was direct, constructive, and kind.
                    Working with her on written content felt not simply like having someone point out errors or
                    developmental issues and demand they be fixed, but instead like she was an ally to both writer and
                    work and wanted to see it in its best form as much as they did. It was a joy to work alongside
                    Bailey, and I highly recommend her to prospective employers.</p>

                <p id="card-text">Bailey is one of the best editors I have ever worked with. Her style of editing is truly unique. She
                    manages to enhance my thoughts without changing my style of writing. It's a pleasure to work with
                    her. Her dedication for what she does really shines through. Even when critiquing my work, Bailey
                    was always respectful and encouraging. Her guidance, impeccable sense of humor and keen eye for
                    editing have enabled me to improve and become a better writer. More importantly though, it's a
                    pleasure to work with Bailey! She is an incredibly amicable person with strong thoughts and opinions
                    that she is not afraid of voicing. She would be a valuable addition to any organization that she
                    chooses to join.</p>
